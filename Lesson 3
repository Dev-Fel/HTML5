<!-- HTML Semantic Tags -->

<!-- Semantic elements used to make navigation and web development have more sense: -->

<!-- example below and explanation below -->

<header>
<img src="logo.svg" alt="site logo">
<h1>NASA</h1>
</header>

<!-- The <header> tag wraps the introductory content of any part of the page. It's allowed to use several <header> elements in one document. -->
<!-- However, most often it's used to form the introductory content of the entire web page, i.e. the header of the site. In the <header> you -->
<!-- usually put the name of the site, its logo, a search form, and so on. -->


<!-- example and explanation below -->

<nav>
  <a href="#">Home</a>
  <a href="#news">News</a>
  <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
</nav>

<!-- The <nav> tag wraps a set of links to navigate the site. You can also use more than one <nav> tag in a document. -->
<!-- Often navigation links are placed inside the header of the site, but not necessarily. -->

<!-- example and explanation below -->

<main>
  <h2>Tracks<h2>
  <div>
    <h3>Frontend developer</h3>
    /* ... */
  <div>
  <div>
    <h3>Python developer</h3>
    /* ... */
  <div>
    /* ... */
</main>

<!-- In the tag <main> you usually put the main content of the HTML document. This tag should not contain elements that are repeated on other -->
<!-- pages of the site: navigation links, name or logo, etc. -->

<!-- example and explanation below -->

<section>
 <h2>About me</h2>
 <p>Hi, I'm ...</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Gallery</h2>
  <div>
    <img src="1.jpg">
    <img src="2.jpg">
  <div>
</section>

<!-- The <section> tag is needed to group logically related content and divide your page into sections. In this context, a section is a thematic -->
<!-- grouping of the content of the page, usually with its own title. For example, the <section> tag can define a news block or contact information. -->
<!-- It is acceptable to place one <section> tag inside another. The <section> tag is not a replacement for the <div> tag. The <div> element is -->
<!-- non-semantic, i.e. it does not tell you anything about the content that is placed inside of it. -->

<!-- example and explanation below -->

<article>
  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p>HTML is...</p>
</article>

<!-- The <article> tag defines independent, self-contained content. Content placed in this element usually makes sense on its own and is -->
<!-- understandable independent of the other parts of the website. You can wrap a forum post, a blog post, or some other self-contained piece -->
<!-- of content in this tag. You can have a few <article> tags on one page, too. -->

<!-- example and explanation below -->

<p>Today I wrote my first JavaScript program.</p>
<aside>
  <p>JavaScript is a programming language.<p>
</aside>

<!-- The <aside> tag defines a part of the document which complements the main content but is not an integral part of it. The <aside> element can -->
<!-- be a sidebar, it can contain additional comments, a list of terms, or advertisements. -->

<!-- example and explanation below -->

<footer>
  <div>
    <a href="/support/">Support</a>
    <a href="/contribute/">Contribute</a>
  </div>
  <p>David Cobb, 2021</p>
</footer>

<!-- The <footer> tag defines the footer for a document or section. The <footer> tag can contain the author's name, the date of the document, or -->
<!-- contact information. It's also ok to use several <footer> tags on one page. -->
